## Introduction

Note - this spec is sectioned off right now. It does not have basic introductions of The Graph, and the stakeholders, because that would be in the intro of the whole specification

The Graph Network uses Proof of Stake (POS) to achieve economic finality by incentivizing the group of distributed nodes to come to consensus on Index Chain data. Proof of Stake is an incentivization protocol on top of a blockchain. Stakeholders can vote, proportional to their stake they have in the network. In the Graph Network the staking is done with The Graph Token, and the nodes which are staking are called **Validators**

Each Index Chain has its own set of Validators. When a user owns Graph Tokens, they can stake them on the Ethereum Mainnet, and become a Validator of an Index Chain of their choosing. The Graph Network Staking Contracts emit events, and these events are the messaging interface at which Index Chains are able to add new Validators. 

Validators are rewarded for producing correct blocks, and punished for misbehaviour. An Index Chainâ€™s block rewards are proportional to how often it is queried, which is determined in the Query Marketplace.

There are three ways to interact with the POS protocol. They are staking, rewards, and slashing. The spec will be described with these three ways in mind. 

TODO: explain the relationship between index chains and subgraphs.

## Stakeholders

Anyone dealing with **bonded stake** within the network. They are: 

* **Validators**: Users that bond tokens and serve up queries in exchange for shared rewards and fees.
* **Fishermen**: Submit slash proofs as on-chain evidence of false queries, for which they are rewarded a fee.

## POS Smart Contracts 

The mainnet staking smart contract is the interface between the Ethereum mainnet Graph Tokens, and the network of Index Chains.

The staking smart contract stores all Index Chain information, as well each chains Validator set. The [**Current Validator Set**](#Types-and-Parameters-and-Message-Formats) stored on an Index Chain directly maps to the staked accounts on the mainnet staking smart contract.

The staking smart contract is designed to punish bad behaviour by slashing, and to reward good behaviour with inflationary block rewards. It is also designed to incentivize all rational actors to be rewarded to make function calls whenever necessary. This is done for simplicity. 

### Connecting Multiple POS Index Chains

The diagram below shows how the staking smart contract is the connection point for all Index Chains.

![POS Architecture](./POS_Architecture.jpeg)

The smart contract will map the the follow data structures:

SubgraphID     --> Index Chain IDs

Index Chain ID --> Validator Set
 
Validator      --> Stake 

Each SubgraphID has a list of the Index Chains within it. Each of those chains has a Validator set, representing the nodes securing the network. Each Validator has a stake they have posted. This design allows for an organized way to see how much is at stake, per Validator, and per Index Chain. 

### Round Progression

- the blockhash of each round will be stored (note, we will find a way to make this less work intensive)
NOTE: most of this should be left to the consensus section 

---

## Staking

The Index Chains watch for events emitted from the Ethereum network to become informed when a change to the Validator set occurs. Events are the best solution to use, since they are Ethereum's main way of comunicating with the outside world. The event emitted will give the Index Chain the information it needs to allow a new Validator to join the Index Chain. The event data is as secure and reliable as the Ethereum main chain. 

This process will be described below in three different ways - bonding, rewards, and slashing. These are the ways that the Index chains interact with the Ethereum main chain. 

### Bonding to Become a Validator

![Bonding Message Diagram](./registerValidator_msg.jpeg)

A user with Graph Tokens finds an Index Chain they would like to validate on. Then they do Step 1:

1. Once they confirm they meet the requirements to stake, they call the mainnet staking contract function registerValidator(), They pass data that indicates which Index Chain they will Validate on. This includes the Index Chain ID, their Validator ID, and the amount of Graph Tokens to stake. Once the becomeValidator() transaction is included in the main chain, it will emit an event :

        Event New Validator(
            Index Chain ID, 
            Graph Network Node ID, 
            Main Chain Account Address (msg.sender), 
            Graph Tokens Staked 
        )

The Index Chain is listening for the mainnet staking smart contract for the NewValidator event with itâ€™s own IndexChainID. The event will get added into a new block on the Index Chain, and it will update the Validator Set. The Index Chain Node ID allows the new Index Chain Node to become a Validator. Then Step 2:

2. The new Validator runs a CLI command in The Graph Network software and it would create you as a validator if after a check (small bond to prevent spam))

### Unbonding to Stop Validating 

![Unbonding Message Diagram](./Unbonding_msg.jpeg)

A Validator can stop validating with one call to the POS smart contract:

1. The Validator calls `stopValidating()` with their Validator ID, and Index Chain ID. Next the Event Stop Validating will be emitted: 

        Event Stop Validating(
            Index Chain ID, 
            Validator ID, 
            Main Chain Account Address (msg.sender), 
        )

The Index Chain Validators are listening for such events, and every Validator will then include an update to the Validator set in the next block. When a majority consensus is reached, the Validator set will be updated, and the Validator will no longer participate in consensus, and their tokens will enter the thawing period. 

### Rebonding Frozen Tokens

When a Validator unbonds tokens, they get put through a thawing period, which could be weeks or months long, depending on how the parameter is set. A delegator is free to rebond tokens that are frozen, with no wait time. This could happen from voluntary unbonding, or from being unbonded due to liveness faults. TODO: (LINK TO LOCATION OF SPEC)

### Changing Stake 

A Validator may want to increase or decrease their stake on their node. This is done by calling `changeStake()` on the POS smart contract. If they are adding stake, it will be added as soon as it can be included in a block. If they are lowering their stake, the tokens must go through the thawing period before they can be released from the POS smart contract.

## Rewards

Note - fees are being left out for now
NOTE - mention of how getting rewarded with queries is left out of detail here for now, as this section focuses more on the messaging between 


__Create action diagram__ - mintInflationTokens() (called daily), claimRewards() (probably 1 diagram, claimRewards() hasnt been made ), then also there needs to be a way to measure the query count , and that needs to be done in the payout claculation

Block rewards are created in order for Validators to receive compensation. This happens on the Ethereum mainnet. With The Graph Network, there needs to be a simple way to pass down the rewards to each Index Chain, and then within each Index Chain, each Validator needs to be rewarded their appropriate amount. 

The minimum and maximum Inflation pecentage is set at the parameter level, first by a multisig controlling account, and eventually by governance voting. The **Current Inflation Rate** will be continuously adjusted, as it aims to match the [**Target Bonded Ratio**](#Types-and-Parameters-and-Message-Formats).

### Pool of Shares

The **Pool** is a data structure created to help with efficient distribution of rewards to each Index Chain, and each Validator. It is used to minimize the amount of state updates required to reward each Validator. This lowers gas usage. The Pool of shares are split up based on the share of tokens that a Validator has compared to the total. This allows for the ratio the change dynamically, while allowing the Validator to take out the tokens in the future, with only a single state change. This design allows us to only modify the state in two places, but update potentially 100â€™s of Validators stake. The Validator can withdraw their tokens when they please from the Pool. The equation for calculating the shares is as follows:

Each day, the following equation is used to increase the amount of total Graph Tokens (in hours, to account for 365.25 days/year):

__(eq. 1) Inflation Rewards = ( 24 hours / 8766 hours ) * Total Graph Tokens * Yearly Inflation__

### Minting and Claiming Graph Token Rewards

The following requirements 

* Rewards are paid out daily
* A node must call the function on the mainnet in order to mint the tokens. Leader Validators (see consensus) of each Index Chain are incentivized to call the function to mint the tokens, and are rewarded to do so based on the current [Leader Minting Reward](#Types-and-Parameters-and-Message-Formats) value
* The payout depends on both the amount staked, and the total queries that the Index Chain has served each day (see Query Marketplace)
* Each Index Chain is able to prove how many queries it has had by having their leader submit a transaction with the amount of fees the Index Chain has collected in a day (see Fees)

The basic rewarding of each Index Chain, and the Validators within that Index Chain are shown in the two equations below:

__(eq. 2) Index Chain Rewards = ( Index Chain Queries / Total Queries ) * Total rewards__

__(eq. 3) Validator Rewards = ( Validators Stake / Total Validators Stake ) * Index Chain Rewards__

The following diagram shows the process of minting rewards, as well as claiming rewards:

![Minting Message Diagram](./minting-diagram.jpeg)

The claiming of rewards must be done by each Validator. When the rewards are minted, they are all placed within the staking smart contract. To do this costs gas, which is why Leaders compete to win the reward that covers the gas, and provides them with extra tokens. But to separately send them to each Validator requires that the Validator calls `claimRewards()`. At this point, they can choose to send the rewards directly to their mainnet account, or to add them to their current stake, with the [`Add To Stake`](#Types-and-Parameters-and-Message-Formats) variable. 

TODO: add in how the query values are shared. each chain must submit their own in time, subject to change, in order for it to work

## Slashing TODO


Note - final slashing parameters not decided. May be adjustable. 
Note - don't get into the dispute process 

__Create action diagram__  - liveness faults doesnt need one. doubleSignFault() needs to be shown (1 diagram)

Explain how the messages connect to mainnet

Actors are to be incentivzed to do all messages

### Fraud Proofs TODO


Fishermen submit these 

How do they submit them?
